A surfer detection algorithm based on a sliding window convolutional neural network implementation inspired by the LeNet-5 network

This repo houses 3 scripts which...
- segment images to produce training data
- train a model
- run the model on a webcam video and visualise the results.

There is also a short gif and jpeg of what our example output looks like.
